            It&apos;s a review site for any game I can conjure up memories
            about. I associate a lot of my favorite memories closely to the
            games I was playing at any given point in my life. Oftentimes people
            are a core part of those memories, and I hope to capture what I like
            or dislike about a game by traveling down memory lane.

            Hi, I&apos;m greenymcgee. I&apos;m a web developer, and I&apos;ve
            loved video games for as long as I can remember. They&apos;ve always
            been a big part of how I relax, get inspired, and think about design
            â€” both technical and creative.

            I started The Verdant Veil because I wanted a new kind of creative
            outlet. Something that wasn&apos;t just code or just writing, but a
            blend of both. A space where I could explore ideas without worrying
            about deadlines or metrics.

            Casual tales of epic journeys, dull landscapes, or somewhere in
            between. As long as there&apos;s a memory, there&apos;s a game to be
            reviewed.

            I&apos;m typically looking for some sort of journey that has an
            incredible story attached to it or something that has really fun
            mechanics, if not both. I&apos;m rarely looking for a shooter, but
            sometimes the mood hits. I like a good strategy game from time to
            time, and I enjoy the occasional superhero flying through the city
            type. I&apos;m pretty likely to pick up a soulsborne, and I can
            really get into a good metroidvania. Nintendo will probably always
            be up to something that I&apos;m interested in for one reason or
            another, and I really go for some cozy games like Minecraft and
            Stardew Valley.
